    <p>
        Teriyaki chicken is chicken coated in teriyaki sauce. The dish comes from the Japanese
        cooking technique called teriyaki, where meat is grilled or broiled with soy sauce, mirin, and sugar glaze.
        Today, teriyaki chicken refers to any chicken with teriyaki sauce - regardless of the cooking method.

    <h2>What is Teriyaki Sauce?</h2>
    <p>
        Traditional teriyaki sauce is made up of four ingredients: soy sauce, mirin, ginger, and sugar. 
        But many chefs have their own takes on teriyaki sauce.

        In this recipe, the teriyaki sauce includes soy sauce, sugar, ginger, cornstarch (for thickening), 
        cider vinegar (instead of mirin), water, garlic, and black pepper.
